'yello!'
"We are concerned with the schedule and the safety of your kids."

This app allows parents, gaurdians, or baby sitters to keep track of their kid's schedules. Version two will allow parents to track their kid's school bus routes and whether the buses are arriving on schedule. Is it a cold morning and you don't want to send your child out to wait for 20 minutes? Or is it after school and your rushing home to meet your babies at the bus stop? Know exactly when the buses will stop and where at all times. Buses also have driver profiles with their pictures and information. Download 'yello!' and ease your worries!
