**App Developer**: Ninti Chance

**App Overview**
'yello!'
"We are concerned with the schedule and the safety of your kids."

This app allows parents, gaurdians, or baby sitters to keep track of their kid's schedules. Version two will allow parents to track their kid's school bus routes and whether the buses are arriving on schedule. Is it a cold morning and you don't want to send your child out to wait for 20 minutes? Or is it after school and your rushing home to meet your babies at the bus stop? Know exactly when the buses will stop and where at all times. Buses also have driver profiles with their pictures and information. Download 'yello!' and ease your worries!

**What I learned**


This project was a great learning experience in navigating React and collaborating with others. Before this project, I understood React conceptually, but I now know that I can successfully apply the material that I have learned.

I have also learned that I should focus on making my code more readible.

**Improvements from Project One**
* Focused on meeting MVP requirements before pursuing REACH goals, which improved time and project management skills
* More interactive with other people
* Appreciated the process instead of downplaying my achievements
* Used React developer tools successfully
* Understand how to read errors even more clearly

**My Proudest Moment**

My proudest moment was being able to help my classmates understandReact or solve a React problem.
